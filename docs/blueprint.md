# **App Name**: Constructify

## Core Features:

- User Roles: Role-based access control for engineers, contractors, and workers, showing each user the interface relevant to them.
- Task Management: Display of assigned tasks for each user.
- Site Plan Integration: Blueprint/site plan display, showing only relevant sections to each user, and annotating with task zones. Ability to highlight completed vs. pending areas on the plan.
- Progress Tracking: Real-time progress tracker displaying task status across the site, area-wise completion on the site plan, and overall project timeline.
- Calendar View: Calendar-based task assignment and deadline overview, with daily, weekly, and monthly task views.
- AI-Powered Comment Routing: Generative AI tool which will use its reasoning ability to categorize and route any comments a user enters when marking a task complete. If the AI determines the comment may constitute a request, notification, or flag a possible safety hazard it will forward it appropriately. If not, the tool will simply add it to the record.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3B82F6) to convey reliability and trustworthiness, in keeping with the app's function to oversee an important process.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6F2FF), subtly desaturated from the primary color to give prominence to more active UI elements. Darker than pure white to reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: Green (#84CC16), an analogous color used to indicate completion, safety, or approval.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, chosen for its clean, modern, neutral, and readable qualities; good for both headlines and blocks of text
- Simple, clear icons to represent task status, material types, and user roles.
- Clean, grid-based layout to present information in an organized manner. Use of cards to group related information. Mobile-responsive design.
- Subtle transitions and animations for task updates and progress indicators to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.
